# Hello! üëã I'm Aysin Akpinar

I‚Äôm a career switcher and scientist-turned-software-developer, recently graduated from Makers Academy Software Engineering Bootcamp (Nov 2024 ‚Äì May 2025), based in London, UK.

Before transitioning into tech, I worked in molecular biology and AI-driven biology projects, which sharpened my analytical thinking, problem-solving, and attention to detail. Now, I‚Äôm passionate about building thoughtful, accessible, and user-focused software. I care deeply about how people interact with technology and am excited to create experiences that are better, fairer, and more intuitive.
